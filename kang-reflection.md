#Audrey's Reflection

```What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?```

  I was struggling with knowing what to write for Commit messages. As well as pushing/pulling to and from github.

```What concepts were clarified during the GPS?```

John was able to clarify what type of commit messages we should be writing.  Such as no past tense form and the first letter of the message should be capitalized.  I knew it was supposed to be short and precise, but it was hard to think of it right on the spot.

```What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?```

I asked a few questions about what are good commit messages and what are good ways to keep track of your git workflow. I believe there were more, but I can't seem to remember now.

```What still confuses you about Git?```

branches I understand are different individual features, but I keep forgetting to add a branch when working on a project. I'm not sure if that is causing me to not see it in github.  I think ultimately the git push and pull concept to and from github I am struggling with.

```How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?```

I have to say it was surprisingly pleasant.  John was a super awesome guide that made it really non intimidated environment(I don't even know if that's even a valid phrase). But he was also to great at explaining concepts that I was a little hazy on.  My Pair Evelyn was also a great pairing partner and we were able to communicate well enough to convey the right directions to each other.
