What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was really struggling with creating feature branches prior to the GPS session. I didn't really understand
how to make new ones, switch between branches, or even what feature branches really were.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I now completely understand how to create new branches, how to switch between branches, and what branches are. 
The instructor made it very easy to understand these concepts that I was struggling with
so much before.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my pair what to name certain commit messages and asked for her help a few times while I was driving. She was 
very attentive and would find answers for me (usually about which commands to use) and help me out. I asked
the guide about shortcuts I could use and he gave me a few that have proven to be very helpful.

What still confuses you about Git?

I can't really pinpoint a specific thing about Git that confuses me, but I can say that I am a bit intimidated by it.
I feel like there is a lot to learn, and I barely know anything.

How was your first experience pairing in a GPS?

I loved it! My pair and I bonded over how nervous we were, but the instructor really put us at ease
and made us more confident about the process as a whole.
